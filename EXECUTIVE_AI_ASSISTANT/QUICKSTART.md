# Executive AI Assistant - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start the Server

**Option A - Using the shell script (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**Option B - Using Python (All platforms):**
```bash
python start_server.py
```

### Step 2: Test the System
```bash
python test_system.py
```

### Step 3: Access the Application
- **Web Interface**: Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
- **API Documentation**: Visit http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Voice Assistant**: Run `python src/prototype/voice_assistant_demo.py`
- **CLI Interface**: Run `python src/prototype/unified_control_demo.py`

## ðŸ”‘ Adding API Keys (Optional)

The system works without API keys but with limited functionality. To enable AI features:

1. Edit the `.env` file:
```bash
# For OpenAI (GPT-4)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# For Anthropic (Claude)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
```

2. Restart the server

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Server won't start?
