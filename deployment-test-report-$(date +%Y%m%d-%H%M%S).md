# LOGOS ECOSYSTEM - Deployment Test Report

**Date:** Monday, June 23, 2025
**Time:** 19:08 UTC-3

## Executive Summary

The deployment has been partially completed with some configuration issues that need attention.

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **API Backend**
   - Status: `200 OK`
   - URL: https://api.logos-ecosystem.com
   - Health endpoint: Working correctly

2. **DNS Configuration**
   - logos-ecosystem.com → 76.76.21.21 (Vercel IP)
   - www.logos-ecosystem.com → cname.vercel-dns.com
   - Resolution: Working correctly

3. **Environment Variables**
   - 4 variables configured in Vercel
   - All properly encrypted
   - Includes API URL, WebSocket URL, and payment keys

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Main deployment URL returns `401 Unauthorized`
   - Requires Vercel authentication to access
   - URL: https://frontend-ckhxcllxt-juan-jaureguis-projects.vercel.app

2. **Custom Domain Configuration**
   - logos-ecosystem.com returns `404 Not Found`
   - www.logos-ecosystem.com returns `404 Not Found`
   - Domains are not properly linked to the deployment

### ⚠️ Pending Verifications

1. WebSocket connectivity
2. Database connectivity
3. Payment webhook integration
4. SSL certificate validation

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is that the custom domains (logos-ecosystem.com) are currently assigned to the "frontend" project, but the latest code is deployed to the "logos-ecosystem" project. This mismatch is causing the 404 errors.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Domain Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Deploy to the frontend project
   cd frontend
   rm -rf .vercel
   vercel --prod --name frontend
   
   # Option 2: Transfer domain to logos-ecosystem project
   # This requires access to both projects
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment Access**
   - The 401 error suggests the deployment requires authentication
   - Check Vercel dashboard for deployment visibility settings

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL production
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL production
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME production
   ```

### Next Steps

1. **After fixing domain issues:**
   - Re-run deployment tests
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Test user authentication flow

2. **Backend deployment:**
   - Deploy backend to AWS ECS
   - Configure RDS database
   - Set up Redis cache

3. **Monitoring setup:**
   - Configure Vercel Analytics
   - Set up error tracking
   - Enable performance monitoring

## Current Status

- **Frontend:** ⚠️ Deployed but not accessible via custom domain
- **Backend API:** ✅ Operational
- **Database:** ❓ Not verified
- **Custom Domains:** ❌ Misconfigured
- **SSL:** ✅ Valid certificates

## Commands for Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check current project
cd frontend && vercel whoami

# List all projects
vercel projects ls

# Check domain ownership
vercel domains inspect logos-ecosystem.com

# View recent logs
vercel logs

# Re-deploy to correct project
vercel --prod
```

## Conclusion

The deployment is technically successful but requires domain configuration fixes to be fully operational. The API is working correctly, which indicates the backend infrastructure is properly set up. The main issue is the mismatch between the project containing the code and the project owning the custom domains.
